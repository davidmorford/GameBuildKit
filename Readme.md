# BuildKit for Games

BuildKit for Games is an experimental project that brings BuildKit, NavigationKit and Cocos2D into a single structure designed to share static libraries and resources with multiple game applications. Please see the readme for BuildKit to get started.

[BuildKit Readme](http://github.com/davidmorford/BuildKit/blob/master/Readme.md)

## Requirement Notes

* BuildKit, and by extension BuildKit for Games, uses the LLVM/Clang 1.5 compiler and flags to enable modern runtime ABI features. This will certainly cause issues if you libraries that use C++ or Objective-C++. To change this behaviour  to LLVM GCC 4.2 or GCC 4.2, change the value of GCC_VERSION and comment out OTHER_CFLAGS in the master xcconfig file for projects in $(ROOT)/Configurations/Project.xcconfig

* BuildKit for Games libraries, projects and templates will most likely target the unified SDK, iOS 4.2, which is still in beta and under NDA.


## Cocos2D and Chipmunk Libraries

* Cocos2D and Chipmunk static library projects based on cocos2d-iphone-0.99.5-beta3 sources pulled from github project.

* The only major change to libraries is making the headers BuildKit compatible so one can do the following:

** #import <Cocos2D/Cocos2D.h>
** #import <Chipmunk/Chipmunk.h>

* Cocos2D library headers have not yet been converted to <Cocos2D/*.h> style yet but will be very, very, very soon.


## BuildKit for Games Xcode Project Template

The template, based on the NavigatorKit universal application Xcode project template, is not setup for a universal-based iOS game application yet. Stay tuned for updatesâ€¦

As with BuildKit, BuildKit for Games has an out of the box Xcode project template. The template uses NavigatorKit in hopes of using URL-based application architecture design to build a cohesive set of application URLs and URL mapped objects, scenes and actions. This template includes project references to the Cocos2D, Chipmunk and NavigatorKit projects as a convenience that rebuilds changed library projects. BuildKit uses xcconfig based setting paths for headers and libraries and for linker paths.

 
## History
